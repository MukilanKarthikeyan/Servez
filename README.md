# Serveasy
**Topic:** A solution to help bring society back to Normal during and post Coronavirus pandemic. In our community, we had used whatsapp to try to provide food for families that had been infected but it was not efficient, or easy to keep track of

**Solution:** 
We have decided to create an app, called “Serveasy.” 

Serveasy is an app designed to offer and find help during the pandemic. 
There are a lot of people willing to  help during this time, but do not know where to start. 
This app is designed to help those in need to ask for help, and those who want to help to find people in need; this app will act as the bridge/medium connecting people. 

**Potential developments:** contact tracing based on codes, 

**Some features we would like to incorporate include:**
* The app will not reveal personal information.
* It will also contain calendar based tasks
* Notifications/reminders will be implemented.
* Groups to help people;for example, elderly who can not go to buy supplies, or cook on their own.
* The app is also specifically targeted to those who are in need and others such as the elderly.


We will utilize Android Studio to develop the app and use the coding language Java. We will also incorporate smallere languages such as HTML and CSS in order to enhance the app so it can reach its fullest potential. 

Things to include: Calendar, google maps for path, and chat groups[each household will be marked with one group(not to be used as social media)


Our desired result: We would like those who need help to receive the help from others in a timely manner. As a result, more people will receive the basic necessities required to reenter society with little to no economic or health issues. We are all in this together, and it is our duty to help those in need during this pandemic, and this application can also be used post-Covid 19 to restore those who were unfortunate and those who were in need.
